The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


* Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

* Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

* Adapt the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
